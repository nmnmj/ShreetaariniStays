Project Overview:
Create a Progressive Web App (PWA) for Shree Taarini Home Stay with a devotional Mahakal Temple theme, strong SEO optimization, and a modular full-stack architecture. The app will include an admin panel for room management and a user-friendly interface for visitors.

Core Requirements:
1. PWA Setup
Implement service workers for offline functionality, caching, and fast loading.

Add a manifest.json file with app icons (use the attached logo as the primary icon).

Ensure HTTPS compliance and app installability.

2. SEO Optimization
Meta tags: Include title, description, and keywords (e.g., "Shree Taarini Home Stay," "Mahakal Temple Accommodation").

Structured data (Schema.org) for LocalBusiness, LodgingBusiness, and TouristAttraction.

Optimize images (compress, lazy-load, and use alt tags).

Server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) for critical pages.

3. Frontend (React/Next.js)
Home Page:

Hero section with a Mahakal Temple background image (provided by the user) and devotional design elements (e.g., trishul icons, Om symbols).

Room Gallery: Grid/cards displaying room images, prices, amenities (AC, Wi-Fi), and a "Book Now" button.

Floating "Call Now" button that triggers a phone call to +91 8770068048 (use tel:8770068048).

Theme:

Color scheme: Saffron, gold, and white.

Devotional fonts (e.g., Sanskrit-style headings).

Subtle animations (e.g., diya lamps, aarti effects).
